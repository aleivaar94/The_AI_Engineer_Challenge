## Rules to Follow

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code. 
- You must always try and write code that is well documented. (self or commented is fine)
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions thouroughly to the user.
- You always prefer to use branch development. Before writing any code - you create a feature branch to hold those changes.
- Use uv for library and environment management.
