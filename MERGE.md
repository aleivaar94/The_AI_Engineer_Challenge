# How to Merge the `ui-enhancement` Branch into `main`

Follow these steps to safely and cleanly merge the `ui-enhancement` branch into your `main` branch using Git:

---

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Switch to the `main` branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

3. **Make sure your `main` branch is up to date:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Merge the `ui-enhancement` branch into `main`:**
   ```bash
   git merge ui-enhancement
   ```
   - If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them in your code editor, then add the resolved files:
     ```bash
     git add <conflicted-files>
     ```
   - After resolving conflicts, continue the merge (if needed):
     ```bash
     git commit
     ```

5. **Push the updated `main` branch to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

---

**Notes:**
- Always review the changes after merging to ensure everything works as expected.
- If you use a GUI (like GitHub Desktop or VS Code), you can perform these steps using the interface, but the commands above are the standard CLI approach.
